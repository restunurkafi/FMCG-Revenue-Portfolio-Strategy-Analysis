# FMCG-Revenue-Portfolio-Strategy-Analysis
FMCG multi-channel sales dashboard built in Excel 2019 analyzing performance across Channel, Brand, and Category. Features dynamic filtering, KPI tracking (Revenue, ASP, Promo %, Stock Out), and portfolio-level business insights with strategic recommendations. Demonstrates commercial analysis and data modeling skills using Excel only.

📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze multi-channel FMCG sales performance across Brand, Category, and Channel dimensions using an interactive Excel dashboard.
This project aims to:
Identify revenue drivers across channels
Understand brand positioning and pricing structure
Evaluate category contribution and portfolio balance
Assess promotional dependency and operational metrics
Generate strategic business insights from transactional sales data
The final output is a dynamic dashboard that allows users to filter performance by Channel, Brand, and Category to simulate business scenarios and decision-making perspectives.

📊 Business Questions Addressed
This analysis is designed to answer key commercial questions such as:
Which channel contributes the most revenue?
Which brand has the strongest pricing power?
Which category drives profitability?
How dependent is each brand on promotions?
How does performance vary across retail formats?
Where are the growth opportunities?

🛠 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preparation
Raw transactional sales data structured into a fact table (SalesData)
Created helper sheets for unique Channel, Brand, and Category lists
Cleaned and standardized metrics (Revenue, Units, Promo %, Lead Time, etc.)

2️⃣ Data Modeling (Excel-Based)
Used structured tables for scalable calculations
Applied dynamic SUMIFS logic with conditional filtering
Implemented wildcard logic ("*") for optional dropdown filters
Separated logic layer (Formula & Logic sheet) from presentation layer (Dashboard)
This ensures:
Calculation transparency
Reduced formula duplication
Modular dashboard design

3️⃣ Rather than focusing solely on data visualization, this project emphasizes business interpretation by:
Identifying portfolio segmentation
Comparing pricing strategies across brands
Assessing channel role within overall revenue structure
Providing strategic recommendations based on findings
