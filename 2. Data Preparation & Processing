💡 Data Source
• The project uses raw transactional sales data provided in CSV format from a Kaggle open-source dataset.
• The dataset is used to simulate commercial performance analysis across multiple business dimensions and retail formats.

📥 Data Import
The data was imported into Microsoft Excel using:
★ Data → Get Data → From Text/CSV
• This method ensures the dataset can be refreshed if the source file is updated.

⚙️ Data Transformation
★ Data cleaning and preparation were performed using Power Query before loading into Excel.
The following steps were applied:
• Selected only relevant analytical columns
• Removed unnecessary fields
• Standardized column names
• Validated and corrected data types (numeric and text fields)
• Ensured the dataset was aggregation-ready
• After transformation, the cleaned dataset was loaded into Excel as a structured table named SalesData.

📊 Data Modeling Preparation
Once loaded into Excel:
• The dataset was formatted as a structured table
• Dynamic calculations were built using SUMIFS
• Multi-criteria filtering was implemented
• Optional dropdown filters were enabled using wildcard logic ("*")
• This preparation ensures the dashboard is scalable, transparent, and easy to update.
